# Tox (http://tox.testrun.org/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.
# This will generate CPU only tests, to get other tests, pass in the
# appropriate make build arguments, ex:
# tox -- -e CPU=1 GPU=1 DIST=1
